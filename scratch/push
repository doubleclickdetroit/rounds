three reasons for push, all of which involve watching a Round:
  1 Round is locked, User wishes to be notified if the lock times out
  2 Round is locked, User wishes to place dibs on the next slide
  3 Round is being viewed, client subscribes to be notified if Round is locked during viewing
  
USER GOES TO VIEW A ROUND WITH ID 123, CLIENT WISHES TO WATCH ROUND LOCK
  POST /api/rounds/123/watch
    # creates a Watching for the Round
    # returns Watching object with a 'subscription' key to the 
    # PrivatePub json of the following format:
    #  {
    #   channel: "/messages/new",
    #   timestamp: 1302306682972,
    #   signature: "dc1c71d3e959ebb6f49aa6af0c86304a0740088d",
    #   server: "http://localhost:9292/faye"
    # }

    # create a Watching for this round
    $.post "/api/rounds/#{round_id}/watch", (watching) ->
      subscription = watching.subscription

      # subscribe to subsequent channel with callback
      PrivatePub.subscribe subscription.channel, (data, channel) ->
        alert data.message

      # authenticate with PrivatePub/Faye server
      PrivatePub.sign subscription
