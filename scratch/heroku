Branches pushed to Heroku other than master will be ignored by this command. If youâ€™re working out of another branch locally, you can either merge to master before pushing, or specify that you want to push your local branch to a remote master. To push a branch other than master, use this syntax:

$ git push heroku yourbranch:master
$ git push heroku heroku:master
