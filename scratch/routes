Routes for API, comments (#) indicate that the HTTP verb is not used, (*) indicates something is unimplemented

A couple caveats:
  1 - feeds only pull in slides... i imagine this may need to change in the future
  2 - *** Comments are marked inappropriate by comments#update {:inappropriate => true} and this needs to be changed ***
  3 - not sure how images (SVG files) are uploaded (multi-part POST to SlidesController?)
