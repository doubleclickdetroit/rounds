Routes for API, comments (#) indicate that the HTTP verb is not used, (*) indicates something is unimplemented

A couple caveats:
  1 - feeds only pull in slides... i imagine this may need to change in the future
  2 - Comments are marked inappropriate by comments#update {:inappropriate => true} ?
  3 - not sure how images (SVG files) are uploaded (multi-part POST to SlidesController?)


Adding a Slide to a Round (first requires RoundLock)
  POST /api/rounds/1/round_lock
  POST /api/rounds/1/slides {:sentence => {...}}

Watching a Round that is locked
  GET  /api/rounds/1/round_lock # check for lock
  POST /api/rounds/1/round_lock/watching
    Watching.create(:round_lock => 1, :user_id => 123)


  ***** WHERE DO COMPLETED ROUND FEEDS GO? *****
  ***** WHERE DO INVITATION FEEDS GO? *****
