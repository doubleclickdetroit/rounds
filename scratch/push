three reasons for push, all of which involve watching a Round:
  1 Round is locked, User wishes to be notified if the lock times out
  2 Round is locked, User wishes to place dibs on the next slide
  3 Round is being viewed, client subscribes to be notified if Round is locked during viewing

    # creates a Watching for the Round
    # returns PrivatePub json to be passed to PrivatePub.sign (JS) like so:
      json = {
        channel: "/messages/new",
        timestamp: 1302306682972,
        signature: "dc1c71d3e959ebb6f49aa6af0c86304a0740088d",
        server: "http://localhost:9292/faye"
      }
    # define callback
      PrivatePub.subscribe"/messages/new", (data, channel) ->
          $("#chat").append(data.chat_message)
